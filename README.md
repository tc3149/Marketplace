# marketplace - A Mobile React Native App

Marketplace is a summer personal project I built to practice and test my React Native and CSS skills. Currently, it only works for mobile devices (IOS and Android), where it can be run by using expo go and scanning the QR code.

No plans as of yet (27-Jan-22) to release or deploy to public appstores.
